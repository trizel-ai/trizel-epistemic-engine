- [ ] Validation framework implementation
- [ ] Registry loader implementation
- [ ] Initial placeholder states

## Upcoming Milestones

### 📋 Milestone 3: Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Schema validation tests
- [ ] Determinism tests
- [ ] Registry loading tests

### 📋 Milestone 4: Documentation Completion
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Contribution guidelines

## Stop Conditions (Phase-2)

This phase is complete when:
1. ✅ All directory structure is in place
2. ⏳ Schema validation is functional
3. ⏳ Registry loading mechanism works
4. ⏳ Basic tests pass
5. ⏳ Core documentation is complete
6. ⏳ No analytical logic is present

## Phase-3 Preview

Phase-3 will introduce:
- Advanced validation rules
- State comparison utilities
- Enhanced documentation
- Integration examples

**Note**: Phase-3 is blocked until all Phase-2 stop conditions are met.
