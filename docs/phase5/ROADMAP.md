# PHASE-5 ROADMAP

**Repository**: trizel-ai/trizel-epistemic-engine  
**Phase**: Phase-5 Planning and Governance Documentation  
**Status**: Planning (Documentation Only)

---

## Overview

Phase-5 is a **documentation and planning phase** designed to establish governance invariants, transition protocols, and future-phase planning boundaries before any implementation begins.

This phase does **not** include code, schemas, validators, execution logic, or behavioral changes.

Phase-5 exists to:
1. Solidify governance constraints for future phases
2. Establish explicit transition criteria
3. Document planning boundaries and methodological restraints

---

## Key Objectives

### 1. Governance Solidification
- Document invariants that must persist across all future phases
- Establish non-negotiable constraints for epistemic safety
- Define boundaries between planning and execution

### 2. Transition Protocol Definition
- Create explicit checklists for phase transitions
- Define freeze criteria and unfreeze protocols
- Establish documentation requirements for future phases

### 3. Future Phase Planning Framework
- Define allowable planning activities
- Establish constraints on pre-implementation design
- Document the boundary between planning and execution commitment

---

## Phase-5 Deliverables

### Documentation Artifacts (Mandatory)

1. **ROADMAP.md** (this document)
   - Phase-5 objectives and scope
   - High-level deliverables
   - Timeline and completion criteria

2. **GOVERNANCE_INVARIANTS.md**
   - Cross-phase governance constraints
   - Non-negotiable epistemic boundaries
   - Methodological restraints that must persist

3. **PHASE_TRANSITION_CHECKLIST.md**
   - Requirements for freezing a phase
   - Requirements for opening a new phase
   - Unfreeze protocols and governance controls

### Non-Deliverables (Explicitly Prohibited)

Phase-5 explicitly **excludes**:
- Code implementation
- Schema definitions
- Validator logic
- Execution pipelines
- CI/CD workflow modifications
- Configuration files
- Behavioral changes of any kind

---

## Timeline and Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Documentation (Current)
- Create core Phase-5 documentation structure
- Establish governance invariants
- Define transition checklist

### Milestone 2: Review and Freeze
- Community/author review of governance documents
- Validation that no code artifacts were introduced
- Freeze Phase-5 documentation

### Milestone 3: Tag and Archive (Post-Merge)
- Tag Phase-5 planning completion
- Archive Phase-5 documentation state
- Establish reference point for future phases

---

## Success Criteria

Phase-5 is complete when:

1. ✓ All three core documentation files exist and are reviewed
2. ✓ Governance invariants are explicitly documented
3. ✓ Transition checklist is complete and actionable
4. ✓ No code, schema, or execution artifacts were introduced
5. ✓ Documentation is merged and frozen
6. ✓ Phase-5 tag is created for archival reference

---

## Relationship to Other Phases

### Phase-4 (Completed)

Phase-5 builds on Phase-4's governance freeze by:

- Generalizing governance principles across all phases
- Establishing transition protocols
- Creating planning boundaries for future work

### Phase-6 and Beyond (Future)

Phase-5 provides:

- Governance constraints for all future phases
- Transition requirements and protocols
- Planning framework boundaries

---

## Governance Status

**Phase-5 Status**: Planning (Documentation Only)  
**Code Changes**: None (Prohibited)  
**Behavioral Impact**: None  
**Freeze Policy**: Documentation review only; squash merge preferred

---

## Enforcement

Any pull request or commit introducing code, schemas, validators, or execution logic under Phase-5 violates the phase scope and must be rejected.

Phase-5 is strictly bounded to **documentation and governance planning only**.

---

## Declaration

This roadmap is effective immediately and defines the scope and objectives for Phase-5.

All Phase-5 work must comply with this roadmap or explicitly document deviations (with governance approval).
