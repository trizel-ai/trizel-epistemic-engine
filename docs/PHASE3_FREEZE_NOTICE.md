# PHASE-3 FREEZE NOTICE  
TRIZEL Epistemic Engine — Deterministic Analytical Execution Framework

---

## Status: PHASE-3 CLOSED AND FROZEN

This document formally declares the completion and freeze of **Phase-3** of the TRIZEL Epistemic Engine.

Phase-3 is now **closed**, **audited**, and **frozen**.

---

## Scope of Phase-3

Phase-3 established and validated:

- A deterministic analytical execution framework
- A strict separation between data ingestion and analysis
- An auditable CI-based execution pipeline
- Contract-driven analytical runs with reproducible outputs
- Formal execution of:
  - `RUN_0001` (archived)
  - `RUN_0002` — `P3.M1.STATE_COVERAGE_AUDIT` (executed and committed via CI)

Phase-3 does **not** include:
- Data collection
- Monitoring logic
- Scientific interpretation of results
- Hypothesis evaluation

---

## Execution and Verification

- All Phase-3 contracts passed CI validation
- Deterministic execution demonstrated under GitHub Actions
- Required artifacts generated and committed automatically
- Output contracts finalized (`manifest.json`, `summary.json`)
- No unresolved execution defects remain

---

## Publication Record

Phase-3 has been **manually published** as an independent milestone:

- **Title**:  
  *TRIZEL Epistemic Engine — Phase-3 Deterministic Analytical Execution Framework*
- **Repository**: `trizel-ai/trizel-epistemic-engine`
- **DOI**: `10.5281/zenodo.18117231`
- **Publication mode**: Manual (author-curated)
- **License**: CC BY 4.0

This publication represents the **canonical archival record** of Phase-3.

---

## Freeze Rules (Effective Immediately)

The following rules now apply:

1. **No modifications** to Phase-3 code, workflows, or artifacts  
2. **No re-execution** of Phase-3 runs under new semantics  
3. **No retroactive changes** to execution contracts  
4. Any future work MUST occur under a new phase (Phase-4 or later)

Bug fixes, extensions, or new analytical methods are **out of scope** for Phase-3.

---

## Forward Path

- Phase-3 is complete and immutable
- Phase-4 may build **on top of** Phase-3 outputs and contracts
- Phase-3 SHALL be cited by DOI in any downstream work

---

## Declaration

This freeze is intentional, explicit, and final.

**Phase-3 is closed.**
