## Phase-2 execution policy (authoritative)
Phase-2 execution is governed by the directive below and is epistemic-only (verification/decidability states; no analysis or theory comparison):

- `docs/PHASE2_EXECUTION_DIRECTIVE.md`
# trizel-epistemic-engine
Phase-2 of the TRIZEL project: an audit-safe epistemic state engine for managing competing interpretations of 3I/ATLAS, strictly separated from ingest and analytical layers.
## Phase-2 Governance

All Phase-2 development is governed through a single canonical Pull Request created from the `phase2/initialize-epistemic-engine` branch.
