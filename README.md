# trizel-epistemic-engine

Phase-2 of the TRIZEL project: an audit-safe epistemic state engine.

## Phase-2 Scope (Authoritative)
Phase-2 is epistemic-only. It defines, stores, and validates epistemic states
without performing physics, analysis, inference, or theory comparison.

All execution rules, constraints, and enforcement logic for Phase-2 are defined in:

docs/PHASE2_EXECUTION_DIRECTIVE.md

Interpretation, modeling, and analysis are explicitly out of scope for Phase-2.
