# TRIZEL Epistemic Engine (Archival Repository)

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine was a multi-phase research program designed to build an **audit-safe, epistemically constrained framework** for handling competing scientific interpretations of rare or ambiguous phenomena.

This repository serves as the **archival record** of that completed program.  
It is no longer a live project and exists strictly in an immutable state for audit, citation, or scholarly review.  

Closure applies to governance authority, not to scientific possibility.

---

## Project Philosophy (Historical Context)

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine was built on the principle:

> Scientific systems must be able to **refuse understanding** before they claim it.

This principle governed the project across its bounded phases.  
As of Phase-5 closeout, the project is concluded as a governance instance.  
The principle remains part of the historical scientific record.

---

## Repository Scope

**This repository provides:**
- Source definitions for the TRIZEL constitutional framework (what terms mean, what principles apply)
- Epistemic principles and foundational concepts
- Historical documentation of the TRIZEL Epistemic Engine program
- Immutable reference for constitutional interpretation

**This repository does NOT provide:**
- Operational governance procedures (→ trizel-core)
- Runtime enforcement mechanisms (→ trizel-core)
- Execution logic or active systems (→ downstream repositories)
- Interpretive authority over scientific claims
- Active development or live services

---

## Relationship to trizel-core

This repository serves as the **immutable definitional source** for the TRIZEL Constitution, establishing foundational epistemic principles and governance definitions.

The **trizel-core** repository (https://github.com/trizel-ai/trizel-core) serves as the **operational governance and registry layer**, implementing procedures and maintaining operational state based on the definitions provided here.

**Separation of concerns:**
- **Definitions** (this repository): What terms mean, what principles apply
- **Governance** (trizel-core): How those definitions are operationally enforced
- **Execution** (downstream): Application of governance in specific contexts

**Operational policies, runtime procedures, and enforcement mechanisms belong in trizel-core.** This repository contains only the definitional constitutional framework and epistemic principles that provide the foundation for the broader TRIZEL ecosystem.

## Project Phases — Concluded Governance Framework

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine was structured into strictly bounded phases,  
each operating under explicit and auditable authority.

### Phase-1 — Conceptual Precursor (External)
**Purpose:** Conceptual framing and philosophical foundations.  
**Status:** Completed externally prior to this repository.

---

### Phase-2 — Epistemic State Engine
**Purpose:** Formalization of auditable epistemic states without interpretation.  
**Status:** Completed and documented in this repository.

---

### Phase-3 — Deterministic Execution Control
**Purpose:** Deterministic execution and execution bias prevention.  
**Status:** Completed and permanently frozen.

---

### Phase-4 — Governance and Evaluation Boundary
**Purpose:** Governance rules preventing interpretive authority.  
**Status:** Permanently locked under governance contracts.

---

### Phase-5 — Finalization and Closeout
**Purpose:** Formal closure of the governance lineage and entry into terminal idle state.  
**Status:** Finalized as documented in  
[PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md](docs/phase5/PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md).

Phase-5 represents the terminal state of the current governance lineage.  
Any future work constitutes a **new project instance**, not a continuation  
of this phase sequence.

## Repository Ecosystem (Historical Reference Only)

During its active lifecycle, the TRIZEL program included supporting repositories.  
All listed repositories now exist for archival reference only:

| Repository                        | Role |
|----------------------------------|------|
| trizel-epistemic-engine           | Constitutional definitions and epistemic principles (this repository). |
| trizel-core                       | Operational governance, enforcement, and registry. |
| trizel-monitor                    | Scientific ingest layer and snapshot integrity. |
| AUTO-DZ-ACT-3I-ATLAS-DAILY        | Immutable observational data snapshots. |
| AUTO-DZ-ACT-ANALYSIS-3I-ATLAS     | Verification-first analytical experiments (archived). |
| trizel-AI                         | Experimental AI interfaces (non-authoritative, historical). |

See "Repository Scope" section above for detailed separation of definitional, operational, and execution concerns.

## Relationship to the Scientific Record

This repository preserves the methodological and governance contributions  
of the TRIZEL program for historical study, audit, and citation.  

The project makes no claims of interpretation, endorsement, or theoretical superiority.

---

## Immutability Policy

This repository operates under strict immutability constraints to preserve definitional integrity:

1. **Change Process:** All changes must be submitted via Pull Request with explicit justification.
2. **Changelog Requirement:** All changes must be documented in CHANGELOG.md before merge.
3. **Immutable Releases:** Tagged releases are permanently frozen and may not be modified.
4. **Versioning:** This repository follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
   - **MAJOR:** Changes to constitutional definitions or foundational principles
   - **MINOR:** New epistemic definitions or governance provisions
   - **PATCH:** Corrections and clarifications that do not alter meaning

---

## Final Status

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine is concluded as a governance project as of Phase-5.

No further actions are authorized under the current project charter.  
This statement does not restrict future scientific research conducted under a new, explicitly defined project charter.  

This repository remains immutable under  
[PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md](docs/phase5/PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md).
