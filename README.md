# TRIZEL Epistemic Engine (Archival Repository)

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine was a multi-phase research program designed to build an **audit-safe, epistemically constrained framework** for handling competing scientific interpretations of rare or ambiguous phenomena.

This repository serves as the **archival record** of that completed program.  
It is no longer a live project and exists strictly in an immutable state for audit, citation, or scholarly review.  

Closure applies to governance authority, not to scientific possibility.

---

## Project Philosophy (Historical Context)

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine was built on the principle:

> Scientific systems must be able to **refuse understanding** before they claim it.

This principle governed the project across its bounded phases.  
As of Phase-5 closeout, the project is concluded as a governance instance.  
The principle remains part of the historical scientific record.

---

## Scope

This repository acts as a **gateway and interface layer** within the TRIZEL ecosystem:

**What this repository does:**
- Provides routing and navigation to TRIZEL governance documents
- Serves as an interface to the epistemic framework structure
- Maintains archival records for audit and citation purposes

**What this repository does NOT do:**
- Does not provide authoritative scientific definitions or interpretations
- Does not enforce theoretical positions or claims
- Does not exercise execution or governance authority over scientific content

---

## Project Phases — Concluded Governance Framework

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine was structured into strictly bounded phases,  
each operating under explicit and auditable authority.

### Phase-1 — Conceptual Precursor (External)
**Purpose:** Conceptual framing and philosophical foundations.  
**Status:** Completed externally prior to this repository.

---

### Phase-2 — Epistemic State Engine
**Purpose:** Formalization of auditable epistemic states without interpretation.  
**Status:** Completed and documented in this repository.

---

### Phase-3 — Deterministic Execution Control
**Purpose:** Deterministic execution and execution bias prevention.  
**Status:** Completed and permanently frozen.

---

### Phase-4 — Governance and Evaluation Boundary
**Purpose:** Governance rules preventing interpretive authority.  
**Status:** Permanently locked under governance contracts.

---

### Phase-5 — Finalization and Closeout
**Purpose:** Formal closure of the governance lineage and entry into terminal idle state.  
**Status:** Finalized as documented in  
[PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md](docs/phase5/PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md).

Phase-5 represents the terminal state of the current governance lineage.  
Any future work constitutes a **new project instance**, not a continuation  
of this phase sequence.

## Repository Ecosystem (Historical Reference Only)

During its active lifecycle, the TRIZEL program included supporting repositories.  
All listed repositories now exist for archival reference only:

| Repository                        | Role |
|----------------------------------|------|
| trizel-epistemic-engine           | Core epistemic engine and governance framework (this repository). |
| trizel-monitor                    | Scientific ingest layer and snapshot integrity. |
| AUTO-DZ-ACT-3I-ATLAS-DAILY        | Immutable observational data snapshots. |
| AUTO-DZ-ACT-ANALYSIS-3I-ATLAS     | Verification-first analytical experiments (archived). |
| trizel-AI                         | Experimental AI interfaces (non-authoritative, historical). |

No repository listed above carries execution or governance authority.

## Relationship to the Scientific Record

This repository preserves the methodological and governance contributions  
of the TRIZEL program for historical study, audit, and citation.  

The project makes no claims of interpretation, endorsement, or theoretical superiority.

---

## Compliance

This repository operates under TRIZEL governance standards as defined in:

- **Governance Framework:** https://github.com/trizel-ai/trizel-core/blob/main/docs/GOVERNANCE.md
- **Registry Standards:** https://github.com/trizel-ai/trizel-core/blob/main/docs/REGISTRY.md

All content and structure within this repository adheres to the governance contracts and registry requirements specified in the canonical trizel-core repository.

---

## Final Status

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine is concluded as a governance project as of Phase-5.

No further actions are authorized under the current project charter.  
This statement does not restrict future scientific research conducted under a new, explicitly defined project charter.  

This repository remains immutable under  
[PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md](docs/phase5/PHASE5_CLOSEOUT.md).
