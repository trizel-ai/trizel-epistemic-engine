# TRIZEL Epistemic Engine

The TRIZEL Epistemic Engine is a **multi-phase research program** focused on building an **audit-safe, epistemically constrained framework** for handling competing scientific interpretations of rare or ambiguous phenomena.

This repository serves as a **public cognitive interface** to that program.  
It is **not** a complete mirror of all execution layers, historical prototypes, or analytical pipelines.

The emphasis of TRIZEL is **governance before interpretation**, **verification before explanation**, and **methodological restraint over theoretical claims**.

---

## Project Philosophy (High-Level)

TRIZEL is built on a single guiding principle:

> Scientific systems must be able to **refuse understanding** before they claim it.

Accordingly, the project is organized into **strictly bounded phases**, each designed to answer a different epistemic question, and each prevented from exceeding its declared authority.

---

## Project Phases — High-Level Overview

### Phase-1 — Conceptual Precursor (External)
**Epistemic question:**  
Why is a verification-first, interpretation-restricted engine necessary at all?

**Role:**  
Conceptual framing, philosophical constraints, early formal definitions.

**Status:**  
Developed outside this repository as papers, conceptual frameworks, and early prototypes.

---

### Phase-2 — Epistemic State Engine
**Epistemic question:**  
What can be stated *without* interpretation?

**Role:**  
Formalization of auditable epistemic states (e.g., decidable / undecidable / constrained).  
No theory comparison, no ranking, no explanatory output.

**Location:**  
Implemented and documented in this repository.

---

### Phase-3 — Deterministic Execution Control
**Epistemic question:**  
How do we prevent execution mechanics from biasing outcomes?

**Role:**  
Deterministic execution rules, strict separation of ingest and analysis, execution audits.

**Status:**  
Completed and frozen under explicit governance documents.

---

### Phase-4 — Governance and Evaluation Boundary
**Epistemic question:**  
How do we prevent the system from claiming understanding?

**Role:**  
Governance rules, evaluation contracts, theory handling without theory comprehension.  
No interpretation, no endorsement, no superiority claims.

**Status:**  
Formally frozen. Governed by explicit contract tests and documentation.

## Repository Ecosystem — High-Level Map

The TRIZEL project spans multiple repositories, each with a clearly defined role.

| Repository | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **trizel-epistemic-engine** | Core epistemic engine, governance framework, and phase orchestration |
| **trizel-monitor** | Scientific ingest layer and data snapshot integrity |
| **AUTO-DZ-ACT-3I-ATLAS-DAILY** | Daily immutable snapshots of official observational data |
| **AUTO-DZ-ACT-ANALYSIS-3I-ATLAS** | Verification-first analytical experiments (separate from governance) |
| **trizel-AI** | Experimental AI interfaces (non-authoritative) |
| **trizel-phase4-gateway** | Early isolated experimentation for Phase-4 concepts |
| **trizel-global-access** | Access control and dissemination tooling |
| **kahyaas-smart-contracts** | Auxiliary governance and formal logic experiments |

Each repository represents either:
- a **phase**,  
- a **supporting module**, or  
- an **auxiliary tool**.

No single repository represents the project in its entirety.

## Relationship to Public Scientific Record

The TRIZEL project was **publicly documented and announced prior to the current repository organization** through peer-addressable Zenodo records.

These records establish:
- scientific lineage,
- methodological continuity,
- and public timestamped disclosure.

Representative (non-exhaustive) examples include:

- **TRIZEL AUTO DZ ACT – Scientific Algorithm v2.0 for Experimental Logic Validation**  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16522543

- **Assessment of the Absence of Magnetic Measurements for the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS (V2 APS Edition)**  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17834092

- **AUTO DZ ACT: A State-Based Verification Framework Applied to 3I/ATLAS**  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17935646

- **AUTO DZ ACT: A Verification-First, State-Defined Framework for Experimental Logic Validation**  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17968772

- **TRIZEL Scientific Ingest Layer — Final Implementation (trizel-monitor)**  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18012859

- **TRIZEL Epistemic Engine — Phase-3 Deterministic Analytical Execution Framework**  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18117231

- **AUTO-DZ-ACT-3I-ATLAS-DAILY — Daily Official Scientific Data Snapshot**  
  Zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18124271

These disclosures are **contextual and declarative only**.  
They do not modify governance rules or introduce new claims.

---

## Governance Status

- Phase-3: **Completed and frozen**
- Phase-4: **Formally frozen under governance contract**

Phase-4 explicitly forbids:
- interpretive claims,
- theory ranking,
- superiority language,
- and claims of understanding.

This repository **documents** those constraints; it does not relax them.
